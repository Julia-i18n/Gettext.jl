# Localization (l10n) and PO files

Once you have internationalized your code by marking translatable strings (see [Internationalization (i18n) API](@ref)), you are ready to start creating translations: this is **localization** (**l10n**) of your program, which is achieved by authoring a `.po` file with a list of translated strings.

In fact, the `.po` files need not be created by the programmer â€” they can instead be contributed by users, which allows native speakers of other languages to help you out.   There are numerous software tools to help people create and edit `.po` files, some of which we mention below.

Localization involves three components: setting up the `po` directory to hold translations, extracting the strings to be translated, and creating/editing `.po` files for various locales.   We summarize each of these components below.

## The `po` directory

Every Julia package or program should set up a `po` directory to contain its translation files.  (For Julia packages, this is typically located in the top level of the package directory, as described in [Gettext for modules and packages](@ref module_gettext).)  The `po` directory's location is configured by a call to [`bindtextdomain`](@ref) in the code (see [Domains](@ref domains)).

The `po` directory will initially be empty, but each new localization should add two files:

```
po/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.po
po/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.mo
```

* Here, `<locale>` is the name of the locale (language and culture) of the localization, typically of the form `ll` or `ll_CC`, where `ll` is the two-letter language code (e.g. `en` for English or `fr` for French), and `CC` is the two-letter code of a country or territory (e.g. `en_GB` would indicate localization for British English).  See also [Locale Names](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Names.html) in the GNU Gettext manual.

* `<domain>` is the name of the Gettext domain used by the program or package (see [Domains](@ref domains)), typically the name of the program or package followed by a unique identifier like a UUID; for a package/module, this is the value of [`__GETTEXT_DOMAIN__`](@ref module_gettext).

* The `<domain>.po` file is a human-readable/editable text file containing the translated messages.   The `<domain>.mo` file is a condensed binary representation of the `<domain>.po` data, which can be generated from `<domain>.po` by the [GNU `msgfmt` program](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Binaries.html).

## Extracting the strings to be translated

The strings to be translated consist of every call to the localization macros `_"..."`,
`@ngettext`, and so on in the program or package (see [Internationalization (i18n) API](@ref)).

Currently, this list of strings must be extracted manually, but in the near future we hope to automate this process.  See: [Gettext.jl#22](https://github.com/Julia-i18n/Gettext.jl/issues/22).

## Creating/editing `.po` files

Once a list of strings has been extracted, typically in the form of a "template" `.pot` file that contains the empty translations (`""`), there are various ways that you can edit/create `.po` files:

* Hand editing: the [format is human-readable](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html); see also [this tutorial](https://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/posts/programming/a-quick-gettext-tutorial.html) and [this `sample.po` file included with Gettext.jl](https://github.com/Julia-i18n/Gettext.jl/blob/d0ab44a4b19b7daf2a7dba41826e1065244110dd/po/fr/LC_MESSAGES/sample.po).
* Various software packages provide `.po` editor tools, including: [Virtaal](https://virtaal.translatehouse.org/), [Poedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poedit), [Gtranslator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtranslator), [Lokalize](https://apps.kde.org/lokalize/)
* [Zanata](http://zanata.org/) and [Weblate](https://weblate.org/) are web-based platforms for collaborating with translators, both of which support `.po` files.
* Various packages to auto-generate translations: e.g. [using Google translate](https://github.com/javadsalman/auto-gettext-translator), [using LLMs](https://github.com/paulsabou/gettext_llm)
* [Translation Toolkit](https://toolkit.translatehouse.org/) provides a number of other automation utilities for `.po` files.

(We hope that this is a useful list of resources, but currently make no specific recommendations.)
